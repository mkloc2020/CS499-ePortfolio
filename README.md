## CS499 Computer Science Capstone Fall 2025

---

## Overview

After completing my Computer Science degree and building my ePortfolio for the CS499 Capstone I can see how much I’ve grown compared to day one. Throughout my classes I’ve learned a lot about programming, database management, and how to solve problems. Revising the Travlr Getaways project to showcase my abilities in this ePortfolio gave me the chance to show the skills I’ve developed and how they connect to my career goals.

Throughout my educational development I discovered that I enjoy working with data and finding ways to make information more useful for people. I learned how to design databases, use CRUD operations, and build applications that connect to those systems. These projects helped me understand how to organize data and make it easier for users to understand what I see. 

I also learned how important communication is because not everyone will understand data the way I do. In several projects I had to explain my designs or present data in ways that made sense to everyone involved. This skill will help me in the future with my career especially when sharing results or explaining data to company leaders or clients.

The Computer Science program also helped me grow in areas like data structures and algorithms, software design, databases, and security. I learned how to better write and structure my code, design programs using modular methods, build reliable databases, and protect systems from security risks. This gave me a stronger understanding of how technology works together and how to build software.

The projects in my ePortfolio highlight these skills and show how far I’ve come. Each category represents something I learned and improved on from problem-solving to creating working software systems. When viewed together they show that I can handle challenges, keep learning, and create sound solutions.

The Computer Science program and the Capstone course helped me solidify my stance in my career and strengthened my confidence in my abilities. I’m now ready to take what I’ve learned and apply it professionally.

## Journal

[Journal: What Makes a Productive Code Review?](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Journal%201.docx)

This journal is the pre-planning stage of my code review. It includes planning for writing a script for my code review for each of the three categories that will be reviewed based on the rubric and the code review checklist.

The three categories include the following: 

- Software design/engineering
- Algorithms and data structures
- Databases

## Code Review

This code review details my plan for my selected artifact, Travlr Getaways, related to the three key computer science categories of software engineering and design, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Showcasing my existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and an explanation of my plan for enhancements.


## Narratives

These projects come from the Travlr Getaways app which I built last semester in CS-465 Full Stack Development I. I ended up choosing this as my sole artifact because I can showcase all three categories with just this one project. Software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. It shows that I can design, build, and improve real software and at the same time keep everything connected between the front end, back end, and database.

[Category One: Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Milestone%20Two.docx)

For Category One I improved the TripCardComponent which shows details of the trip like name, resort, price, and description. In my initial project the edit button was non functional. The only thing it did was log to the console. I fixed this by adding navigation with Angular’s Router. Now when someone selects Edit on the webpage it takes them to the Edit Trip page instead of nothing. This update helped improve the user experience and added an important feature. I solidified my knowledge on how routing and components work together and how small changes in the design can make a big difference for the user. 


[Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Milestone%20Three.docx)

For Category Two I enhanced the Trip Listing Component. Before it only listed all trips without any kind of organization or filters. I added search and filter options which lets you look up trips by name, price or resort. I had to write logic that checks and compares values in arrays. This taught me more about loops, conditions, and working with different data types. This update made the app more interactive and efficient, which shows my ability to apply algorithmic thinking to real-world problems.


[Category Three: Databases](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Milestone%20Four.docx)</br>

For Category Three I improved travler.js which defines how trip data is stored in MongoDB. The original version didn’t have good validation, this means bad data can get through. I fixed this by adding a few rules. Now the trip codes are unique, prices have to be positive, and start dates have to occur on a future date. I also changed the perPerson field from a string to a number so that prices could be compared and sorted. After making that change I updated the front end to match which kept the formatting the same. These improvements made the database better and more reliable and I learned how little updates can make a big difference in data quality.

## Professional Self-Assessment

After completing my Computer Science degree and building my ePortfolio for the CS499 Capstone I can see how much I’ve grown compared to day one. Throughout my classes I’ve learned a lot about programming, database management, and how to solve problems. Revising the Travlr Getaways project to showcase my abilities in this ePortfolio gave me the chance to show the skills I’ve developed and how they connect to my career goals.

In the past two years I discovered that I enjoy working with data and finding ways to make information more useful for people. I learned how to design databases, use CRUD operations, and build applications that connect to those systems. These projects helped me understand how to organize data and make it easier for users to understand what I see. 

I also learned how important communication is because not everyone will understand data the way I do. In several projects I had to explain my designs or present data in ways that made sense to everyone involved. This skill will help me in the future with my career especially when sharing results or explaining data to company leaders or clients.

Each category represents something I learned and improved on from problem-solving to creating working software systems. When viewed together they show that I can handle challenges, keep learning, and create sound solutions.

Overall the Computer Science program and the Capstone course helped me solidify my stance in my career and strengthened my confidence in my abilities. I’m now ready to take what I’ve learned and apply it professionally.
