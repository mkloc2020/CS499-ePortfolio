## Overview

This repository documents my process of developing my ePortfolio as part of the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course. The purpose of this ePortfolio is to showcase my skills, growth, and experience throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. I began the program at the end of 2023 after completing my associate degree at my local community college.

Throughout my time in the program, I have gained valuable experience in database design and management, learning to apply CRUD operations and connect databases to applications. I have also strengthened my programming abilities in both Python and Java—languages I had limited experience with before entering SNHU. Additionally, I have developed a strong understanding of software development principles such as modular design, problem-solving, and testing.

The artifacts included in this portfolio demonstrate my ability to meet the program’s key outcomes. They highlight my problem-solving skills through improved database searches and enhanced dashboard functionality, my software design and development skills through the use of modular programming and code reusability, and my data analysis and visualization skills through refined dashboards that display meaningful insights to users.

These enhancements directly align with my career goal of becoming a data analyst. The ability to manage and analyze data, build applications that interact with datasets, and communicate findings through visualizations are all essential skills in this field. This specialization strengthens my expertise in both the technical and analytical aspects of computer science, preparing me for a successful career in data-driven industries such as retail and healthcare.

### Journals

[Journal: What Makes a Productive Code Review?](CS499/CS499-M1-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Self-Introduction")

This journal is the pre-planning stage of my code review. It includes planning for writing a script for my code review for each of the three categories that will be reviewed based on the rubric and the code review checklist.

The three categories include the following: 

- Software design/engineering
- Algorithms and data structures
- Databases

[Journal: Capstone Reflection](CS499/CS499-M7-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Capstone Reflection")

This journal serves as a reflection on my experience throughout the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course. It highlights how I achieved the five course outcomes by refining and enhancing the artifacts featured in my ePortfolio. The result is a professional portfolio that effectively demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and competencies I have developed throughout the Computer Science program.

### Code Review

[Code Review](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9rt22q "CS499 Code Review Video")

This code review details my plan for my selected artifact, Travlr Getaways, related to the three key computer science categories of software engineering and design, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Showcasing my existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and an explanation of my plan for enhancements.

### Category One: Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

[Category One: Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Milestone%20Logs/Milestone%20Two.docx)

This Milestone log for Category One includes my enhancement for software engineering and design. I completed the implementation of a fully functional edit button which shows that I can debug and modify complex Angular components and routing logic. This update helped improved the user experience and added an important feature that supports real-world software development practices.

### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement

[Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Milestone%20Logs/Milestone%20Three.docx)

This Milestone log for Category Two includes my enhancement for algorithms and data structure. This enhancement shows how I can use arrays and filtering logic to make both the functionality and the user experience better. I added a search bar that allows users to filter trips by name or resort, a maximum price filter that limits results by budget, and an empty state message that appears when no trips match the search or filter. These improvements required me to write filtering algorithms that check both text and numeric conditions at the same time, which shows my ability to apply algorithmic thinking to real-world problems.

### Category Three: Databases Enhancement

[Category Three: Databases](https://github.com/mkloc2020/CS499-ePortfolio/blob/main/Milestone%20Logs/Milestone%20Four.docx)</br>

This Milestone log for Category Three includes my enhancement for databases. I chose to make changes to the Trip Schema. This is located in travlr.js which is part of the back-end database design. This schema outlines the structure of all the trip data stored in MongoDB which have fields like code, name, resort, price, and description.

### Professional Self-Assessment

Finishing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and building my ePortfolio for the CS499 Capstone has helped me see how much I’ve grown as a student and future professional. Throughout my classes, I’ve learned a lot about programming, database management, and how to solve real problems using technology. Putting my projects together for the ePortfolio gave me the chance to show the skills I’ve developed and how they connect to my career goals.

During the program, I discovered that I really enjoy working with data and finding ways to make information more useful for people. I learned how to design databases, use CRUD operations, and build applications that connect to those systems. These projects helped me understand how to organize data and make it easier for users to interact with. I also got better at planning and improving my code so it’s easier to update and reuse later on.

Working with others was another important part of the program. Some assignments involved teamwork, which taught me how to share ideas, listen to others, and combine different strengths to get the job done. Communicating with classmates and explaining technical ideas in simple terms helped me get more comfortable with working in group settings, something that’s very important in the tech field.

I also learned how to communicate better with different types of people, including those who might not have a background in technology. In several projects, I had to explain my designs or present data in ways that made sense to everyone involved. This skill will be very useful in my future career, especially when sharing results or explaining data to company leaders or clients.

The program also helped me grow in key areas like data structures and algorithms, software design, databases, and security. I learned how to write clean and efficient code, design programs using modular methods, build reliable databases, and protect systems from security risks. These lessons gave me a stronger understanding of how technology works together and how to build safe, effective software.

The projects in my ePortfolio highlight these skills and show how far I’ve come. Each artifact represents something I learned and improved on, from problem-solving to creating working software systems. Together, they show that I can handle challenges, keep learning, and produce quality work.

Overall, the Computer Science program and the Capstone course helped me find direction in my career and strengthened my confidence in my abilities. I’m now ready to take what I’ve learned and apply it to a professional role, especially in data analysis. My ePortfolio is a reflection of my hard work, my progress, and my readiness to start a successful career in the computer science field.
